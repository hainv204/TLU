2.Negative:
En:Basically, the film centers around a group of friends who venture into a haunted house. What starts as an exciting premise quickly turns into a tedious mess. The pacing is so slow that I found myself checking the time every few minutes. The characters are one-dimensional, and their decisions often make no sense. Instead of feeling scared, I just felt frustrated. I was hoping for a thrilling horror experience, but instead, I got a boring drama with a few jump scares thrown in. 2 out of 10 for the effort, but I wouldn’t recommend wasting your time on this one

En:The movie was way too slow and boring! I struggled to stay awake while watching

En:Instead of feeling scared, I just felt frustrated by the characters' stupid decisions.
